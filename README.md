# Summary

![Build and deploy](https://github.com/streof/streof.github.io/workflows/Build%20and%20deploy/badge.svg?branch=gh-pages)

This repo contains the source code for my personal blog. It uses
[zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) as a static site generator and a [zola
adaptation](https://github.com/pawroman/zola-theme-terminimal) of the
[terminal theme](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal).
